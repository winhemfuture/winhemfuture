### Hi there 👋

I'm try to be good programmer.

🔭 I’m currently working on Java and Javascript.
🌱 

I used Javascript, Java, HTML, CSS, Twig, PHP, Python, C and SQL.

I want to become a good backend programmer. Because I like fix the problems and solve the complex equations and push forward myself.


Look at my projects to get information about me 🙂
