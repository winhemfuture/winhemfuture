### Hi there ðŸ‘‹

I'm try to be good programmer.

ðŸ”­ Iâ€™m currently working on PHP and Python.
ðŸŒ± Now I'm working on Php Symfony with the help of Patika.dev

I used PHP, Java, HTML, CSS, Twig, Javascript, C#, C and SQL.

I want to become a good backend programmer. Because I like fix the problems and solve the complex equations and push forward myself.


Look at my projects to get information about me ðŸ™‚
